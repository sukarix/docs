**Sukarix** is an open-source modern PHP framework built to empower developers by facilitating rapid development of web
and CLI applications with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Born out of the need for a streamlined,
performance-oriented framework, Sukarix builds on top of the Fat-Free Framework to offer a solid foundation that is both
lightweight and feature-rich.

## Philosophy

Sukarix Framework embraces a philosophy built on principles designed to enhance your development process and deliver
robust, scalable applications. Here’s what defines our approach:

1. **_Lean yet Robust_**
    - **Powered with F3 (Fat-Free Framework):** While F3 provides a lightweight core, Sukarix builds on this foundation,
      adding just the right amount of structure and modern features to deliver a robust, feature-rich experience without
      overwhelming complexity.

2. **_Proven Expertise_**
    - **Real world experience:** Sukarix has been rigorously tested in production environments from 2016 to 2024,
      covering a wide range of applications including CLI tools, web apps, React applications, APIs, middleware, and
      reverse proxy apps. This extensive testing under diverse conditions demonstrates the framework's reliability and
      versatility, ensuring its readiness for public release in 2024.

3. **_Stability Over PHP Versions_**
    - **Minimalistic upgrades:** Sukarix is designed to ensure stability across different PHP versions with minimal
      changes required. The framework is built in such a way that upgrading your PHP version typically requires no
      adjustments to the framework itself, simplifying maintenance and ensuring long-term compatibility.

4. **_Rich in features_**
    - **Best-in-Class Libraries:** Sukarix incorporates the best PHP libraries available from the open-source community,
      offering enterprise-level features that meet the demands of complex business applications.

5. **_Efficiency first_**
    - **Simplicity and Performance:** When multiple approaches exist for a feature, we prioritise using the Fat-Free
      Framework's methods for their proven efficiency. Features are designed and continually refined to ensure the most
      performant outcomes while maintaining simplicity.

6. **_Flexibility in approach_**
    - **Multiple ways to succeed:** While Sukarix standardises the use of the Fat-Free Framework (F3), it remains
      flexible, allowing developers to utilize F3’s core features, its plugins, and a range of open-source libraries to
      craft alternative solutions. This approach provides developers the freedom to choose or create the method that
      best fits the specific requirements of their projects.

7. **_Smart defaults_**
    - **Convention Over Configuration:** Sukarix is built on the principle of "It just works!" By promoting conventions
      over configurations, the framework provides smart defaults that streamline development tasks, enabling developers
      to focus more on innovation and less on setup.

8. **_Testability_**
    - **Comprehensive Testing:** Sukarix is equipped with built-in tools for both CLI and browser-based unit testing,
      ensuring the reliability and performance of applications through thorough testing. While the framework does not
      depend
      on PHPUnit, developers have the flexibility to integrate it or any other testing frameworks into their projects as
      needed.

## Features

- **Elegant Routing System**: Define your routes elegantly and intuitively, ensuring that your application logic is
  separated from the routing layer.

  clean and manageable way.
